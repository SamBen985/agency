      <p className="para">How do we use data from end users?</p>
      <p className="para">
        M O M Stocks primarily uses end user data for the purpose of tracking an
        end user from an Affiliate to an Advertiser. Tracking enables us to see
        that an end user has visited an Affiliate's service, found a product,
        and clicked the link to be taken to the Advertiser's service to review
        or purchase the product.
      </p>
      <p className="para">
        The purpose of tracking is to attribute sales and marketing effort by an
        Affiliate to a particular transaction, to enable Advertisers to reward
        Affiliates on a per transaction basis. Tracking also allows M O M Stocks
        to provide Affiliates and Advertisers with related reports. The majority
        of these reports contain only aggregated statistical data.
      </p>
      <p className="para">
        M O M Stocks doesn't know who the end user is, simply that the same end
        user started their journey with the Affiliate and completed it with the
        Advertiser and that the affiliate marketing campaign was therefore
        successful in respect of that end user.
      </p>
      <p className="para">
        By maintaining a limited user profile which does not reveal an end
        user's name or identity, M O M Stocks can also understand an end user
        journey when it starts on one device and ends on a different device.
        Through this functionality, M O M Stocks can understand whether a
        referral is commenced on one device and completed on another device. The
        profile is only used to attribute sales and marketing effort to an
        Affiliate, even if the end user has changed devices before completing a
        transaction.
      </p>
      <p className="para">
        M O M Stocks permits Affiliates to enquire as to whether an action by a
        user ought to have generated a commission for that Affiliate. This
        necessitates the sharing of information, between Affiliates and
        Advertisers. Advertisers use the information provided by Affiliates to
        verify against their own records. M O M Stocks enables this data sharing
        and the payment of any commission due to the Affiliate as a result.
      </p>
      <h5 className="h5">How do we collect data from end users?</h5>
      <p className="para">
        The main technologies used for M O M Stocks's tracking are Tracking

        data M O M Stocks uses is machine generated. It lets us single out a

        data to make predictions or evaluations of users' interest or
        personalities.
      </p>
      <p className="para">
        M O M Stocks is one part of the affiliate marketing ecosystem (see our
        Agreement with Advertisers and Affiliates below) and does not always
        have absolute control over the personal data that it receives from
        users, Affiliates or Advertisers.
      </p>
      <p className="para">
        M O M Stocks stores an individual sequence of figures in respect of a
        transaction that does not reveal the name of a particular end user and
        contains information on the Advertiser's campaign, the Affiliate, the
        end user action (i.e. a click or a view and in which country it
        occurred), and the device that is used.
      </p>
      <p className="para">
        M O M Stocks also receives limited transactional information via the
        Journey Tag, to confirm that a transaction has occurred and carry out
        accurate commission allocating, billing and reporting. Such information

        and sales channel.
      </p>
      <p className="para">
        M O M Stocks's data processing activities relating to end user data, do
        not require the direct identification of an individual and therefore M O
        M Stocks mostly holds what is known as "pseudonymous" data in this
        respect. Pseudonymisation is privacy-enhancing. It is the separation of
        data from direct identifiers so that data can no longer be attributed to
        a specific individual without the use of additional information.
      </p>
      <p className="para">
        Pseudonymisation, therefore, reduces the risks associated with data
        processing, while also maintaining the data's utility.

        Does M O M Stocks have legitimate interest in using data?

      <p className="para">

        interests as a basis for processing user data for the purposes set out
        in this section of the Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p className="para">
        When assessing M O M Stocks's legitimate interest, the interests of the
        full affiliate ecosystem were considered. A balancing test was carried
        out and it was confirmed that tracking carries no risk or a very low
        risk of undue negative impact on the end user's interests or fundamental
        rights and freedoms. Legitimate interests are not limited to the
        interests of M O M Stocks but can be legitimate interests of a third
